# Define a stream that points to another. This allows 3.7 images to track a version of RHEL appropriate for them
# and to change that target with a single change if the RHEL version bumps. 
rhel-for-ocp-3.7:
  stream: rhel7-7.3

# The target image for a given version of RHEL does not change often. When it does, it is for a embargoed CVE. 
# In the past, we have forgotten to return the FROM field of a Dockerfiler back to the non-CVE image name
# and continued to build off the special CVE version for too long. The override/expires date will be programmatically
# honored and return back to the correct image.
